The given code for list.dart cannot be directly run  by inserting or writing the code for  main function like

void main() {
  runApp(ListWidget());
}
as there will be  errors like No Directional Widget found etc and no cross axis or main axis  directions are defined  due to the term   const
at    “const ListWidget({super.key});”        under StatelessWidget  and StatefulWidget
Hence we have to   write a    seperate code for our main.dart    as
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'list_widget.dart';
void main() {
  runApp(WidgetApp());
}
class WidgetApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'List-Widget App',
      initialRoute: '/',
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => ListWidget(),
      },
    );
  }
}
Hence this main.dart code   redirects us/ users to the main screen ie our ListWidget screen without giving errors 
Few more changes can be made to the existing list.dart  those are changing the Container colour  using  color: Colors.blue, etc    and changing the colour of the  MaterialButton using   color: Colors.white70, etc
If we do not change the colour of the material button using above procedure  we cannot see the "+"  button which is existing and becomes invisible to the users.
The default Container colour is given as black  ,  we can change it if we want according to our requirement.
Here  If we try to give the title of the Application using MaterialApp , Scaffold and  AppBar either in main.dart or  list.dart  our application may not work as    in the main.dart it has to  redirect  to list.dart ie ListWidget where as in  list.dart as there is  a returning Container already we cannot use  MaterialApp,Scaffold and  AppBar etc  again and we may face errors like black screen or invisble content etc.
